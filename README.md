# Mobile Programming HW5
No cheating. [Instructions here](http://ww2.cs.fsu.edu/~yannes/homework/Homework5.pdf).

## Prompt
Your objective for this homework is to build the back-end database to Homework 2! You
will be creating a SQLite Database to handle this task.

## Extra Credit Completed?
Yes, the first option: "Create a separate Activity that houses a ListView with the contents of the database".

## Compatibility
Tested with API level 25 using an emulator with a Nexus 6P base.

### Known issues
* The table view will throw an error with API level 22 when using the transition buttons. I believe this to be a bug with that level of android, and not my code.
